# Bokeh Python data vizualization library demo #

The goal of this project is to demostrate main features and functionality available for users of Bokeh visualization library.

Bokeh is an interactive visualization Python library with a very intuitive language and a smooth learning curve. Is allows a user with basic Pythin skills to create highly interactive and visually attractive data stories without any significant amount of in-depth learning.

### Dataset ###
For this project I have found a relatively small dataset on world's socio-economic development available at [the United Nations Open Data source](https://data.un.org). Among other indicators, it represents data on the infectious deceases prevalence across the globe for 2000â€“2015, the good old pre-COVID-19 era. The initial and cleaned data files are available at the [Data section](https://github.com/ikviatkovski/bokeh_demo/tree/master/Data) of project's repository.

### Exploratory Data Analysis ###
Data Analysis for the current project is quite basic. It includes some minimal EDA and cleaning. A corresponding [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/ikviatkovski/bokeh_demo/blob/master/Code/EDA.ipynb) is available in the project's repo.

### Simple Visualizations ###
This is the Part 1 of this project. It includes Bokeh basics and serves as a base for a corresponding Medium publication ["Top 5 Simple Techniques for Data Visualization Using Bokeh"](https://medium.com/@aperol/top-5-simple-techniques-for-data-visualization-using-bokeh-a7fa4e05d6e6?source=friends_link&sk=30991d1ad9341415d981895489b01fc7). The notebook [Simple Visualizations](https://github.com/ikviatkovski/bokeh_demo/blob/master/Code/Simple%20Visualizations.ipynb) available from the project's repository is an extended and detailed version for the article.
